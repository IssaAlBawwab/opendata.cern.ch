## <a name="env">"What is CMS NanoAOD?"</a>

"NanoAOD" is a new data format created by CMS for Run 2 physics analyses. It is available for data collected in 2016 and later. In contrast to the [AOD](/docs/cms-getting-started-aod)) and [MiniAOD](/docs/cms-getting-started-miniaod) formats, NanoAOD is not based on CMS-specific C++ classes, but rather stores data in standard C++ types within a ROOT `TTree`. You therefore **do not** need to use the CMS Virtual Machine or docker container to analyze NanoAOD data. NanoAOD can be analyzed using the [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) program and/or python libraries capable of interpreting the ROOT's `TTree` structure.

* ROOT: the ROOT program can be [installed on your local machine](https://root.cern/install/), or you can use the [ROOT docker container](/docs/cms-guide-docker#nanoaod).
* Python: libraries that are useful for interpreting ROOT file formats are found in the [Scikit-HEP project](https://scikit-hep.org/) (particularly `uproot` and `awkward`). A [python docker container](/docs/cms-guide-docker#nanoaod) with access to all the required packages is also available.

NanoAOD data can be accessed by:

* Direct download: after identifying an Open Data Portal record, download the files using the [cernopendata-client](https://cernopendata-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The ["Downloading data files"](https://cernopendata-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#downloading-data-files) method will download all the files of a certain record to the local machine.
* XrootD: ROOT contains a network streaming protocol for reading data files called XrootD. A file list can be obtained from the bottom of a dataset's Open Data Portal record ([example](/record/6021/files/CMS_Run2012B_SingleMu_AOD_22Jan2013-v1_110000_file_index.txt)), or by using `cernopendata-client`. Once you know the path to a NanoAOD file, you can access it over the network using ROOT. The following example is done inside the ROOT docker container:

```shell
$ root -l root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2016H/DoubleMuon/NANOAOD/UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1/2510000/127C2975-1B1C-A046-AABF-62B77E757A86.root

Warning in <TClass::Init>: no dictionary for class pair<edm::Hash<1>,edm::ParameterSetBlob> is available
(TFile *) 0x561a48eaade0
```
(These warnings can be safely ignored for data analysis.)

Within a ROOT script, the `TFile::Open` method can be used to access the file:

```shell
root [2] TFile *f = TFile::Open("root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2016H/DoubleMuon/NANOAOD/UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1/2510000/127C2975-1B1C-A046-AABF-62B77E757A86.root")
```


## <a name="data">"OK! What is in the CMS NanoAOD data?"</a>

Each NanoAOD file contains several `TTree` objects containing different information about the data. This file format is documented in the [CMS SWGuide Workbook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookNanoAOD). The most significant for data analysis is the `Events` tree, followed by the `Runs` tree.

```shell
$ root -l root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2016H/DoubleMuon/NANOAOD/UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1/2510000/127C2975-1B1C-A046-AABF-62B77E757A86.root

```

Within each tree, different "branches" represent quantities of interest whose information is stored for each collision event (real or simulated) in the dataset.
When NanoAOD files are produced, the branches are all given short documentation strings to aid the user that are collected into a webpage:

* NanoAODv9 Data: [contents](https://cms-nanoaod-integration.web.cern.ch/autoDoc/NanoAODv9/2016ULpostVFP/doc_SingleMuon_Run2016H-UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1.html) and [size](https://cms-nanoaod-integration.web.cern.ch/autoDoc/NanoAODv9/2016ULpostVFP/size_SingleMuon_Run2016H-UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1.html) information.

Let's see what a NanoAOD file looks like from the ROOT command line, using the docker container. Follow the commands shows above to open a DoubleMuon NanoAOD file using XrootD.

```shell
root [6] Events->Show(2)   # prints tree contents for event #2.

======> EVENT:2
 run             = 281616
 luminosityBlock = 7
 event           = 386901
 ...
 ...
 nMuon           = 2
 Muon_dxy        = -0.00117493,
                  0.00658798
 Muon_dxyErr     = 0.0996094,
                  0.0996094
 Muon_dxybs      = -0.00116634,
                  0.00656891
 Muon_dz         = -0.225708,
                  0.487549
 Muon_dzErr      = 4.6875,
                  5.1875
 Muon_eta        = 0.902222,
                  0.339417
 ...etc...
```

This shows the basic structure of the NanoAOD file. For event #2, some branches hold a single value for the event (`nMuon = 2`) while other branches hold an array of values for the event.
In this event the pseudorapidity (`eta`) values for the 2 muons are stored in an array with 2 elements.

## <a name="nice">"Nice! But how do I analyse these data?"</a>

The first step to analyzing NanoAOD data is to build up an understanding of what the different branches mean for physics, and how typical CMS physics analyses use these quantities to select interesting events and reconstruct particle decays. Several resources are available to help:

* [CMS Open Data Guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/): a user's manual for the CMS Open Data with pages covering each of the major physics objects in CMS and many common analysis features such as uncertainties.
* [CMS Open Data Workshops](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/cmsOpenData/workshops/): a series of workshops to train researchers to analyze CMS Open Data. Most workshops have included a simplified analysis lesson that uses files in a NanoAOD-like format.
* [NanoAOD SWGuide Workbook page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookNanoAOD): a documentation page for the NanoAOD file format, with an overview of the major physics objects included and links to the production software. Note: this is a wiki site that is updated periodically by CMS and may contain newer information than is relevant for Open Data, and links on the page may point to internal CMS resources.

The second step is to determine a software method for performing validated event filtering, event selection and subsequent analysis. **Note: Collision data in NanoAOD format has not been filtered to contain only the validated run segments. A `json` file containing validated run segments can be found in the links on each collision dataset record.**

#### NanoAOD on the ROOT command line

As we've mentioned, NanoAOD data is stored using ROOT's `TTree` object. The data can be explored interactively by drawing histograms of various tree branches, even applying weights and cuts to the histograms. In the ROOT container, start the [VNC server for X11 graphics support](/docs/cms-guide-docker#vnc). The default password is `cms.cern` for either a VNC viewer or the web browser. Then open a NanoAOD file using XRootD and follow these example commands to draw histograms.

```shell
$start_vnc

Before exiting the ROOT session, your histogram canvas should look something like this:

#### NanoAOD skimming and analysis with `NanoAOD-tools`

The [NanoAOD-tools](/record/12507) software provides a toolkit to perform operations on NanoAOD files outside the CMSSW software environment. This program can be used to:

* skim events that fail the validation
* skim events that fail an analysis condition based on NanoAOD branch contents
* drop branches from the NanoAOD file to reduce its size
* compute many common corrections for simulation
* compute new observables in user-created modules

Skimming data events that fail the validation is a critical feature, so let's see how to do it by following instructions from the [NanoAOD-tools repository](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/nanoAOD-tools/). This example will be performed in the [ROOT docker container](/docs/cms-guide-docker#nanoaod) using files from the [Tau 2016H dataset](/record/30565). The instructions here download files via `git clone`, but it is also possible to download a `.zip` file of the NanoAOD-tools repository from the [record page](/record/12507)

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/nanoAOD-tools.git NanoAODTools

Now we will download the validated runs file that is linked from the Tau dataset record page:

```shell

```

NanoAOD-tools is based on a "postprocessor" script that can perform different options based on the options provided. To skim the file according to the validated runs json file
we will use the `-J` option. In the following example, the 2 GB NanoAOD file has been downloaded locally using `xrdcp` to speed up processing time. To process the file without downloading it, use the full `root://eospublic` file path shown in the `xrdcp` command when running `nano_postproc.py`.

```shell
$ xrdcp root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2016H/Tau/NANOAOD/UL2016_MiniAODv2_NanoAODv9-v1/260000/03DD0FB3-219B-C54D-A476-EE8937CC214E.root .

```

As before, the `TClass` warnings from ROOT can be safely ignored. The [NanoAOD-tools README](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/nanoAOD-tools/) page shows more options for this command and discusses their "module" format for applying corrections, performing further event selection, and storing user analysis variables in the file.

#### More example analysis frameworks

The ROOT Trees within NanoAOD files have been a common HEP data structure for many years, and classic "event loop" methods (primarily written in C++) are an effective and understandable model for analyzing NanoAOD. However, as the overall CMS data size has grown, "columnar" analysis methods have become more and more popular within CMS, and can reduce the computing resources needed for the analysis. The core message is that **NanoAOD is extremely flexible**!

* Event loop: as a generic example, see the [ROOT TTree](https://root.cern/doc/master/tree1_8C.html) tutorials. In the Open Data context, the [example analyses using "NanoAODRun1"](/record/12506) derived data can be replicated for newer NanoAOD files.
* RDataframe: ROOT has developed the [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) package to integrate columnar analysis natively. Several outreach examples using older Open Data in NanoAOD format, such as this [Higgs analysis example](/record/12360) use RDataFrame in the `skim.cxx` scriptto select events and reconstruct a particle. Some example analyses in the [NanoAODRun1Examples](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/NanoAODRun1Examples) repository also use RDataFrame, in both C++ and Python.
* Coffea/Scikit-HEP tools: significant work has gone into developing HEP software tools within a scientific python ecosystem. The [Analysis Grand Challenge](https://agc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) from the [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/projects/agc.html) project have created an analysis example that reads NanoAOD files to measure the top quark pair production cross section. The example uses 2015 Open Data that was independently processed as NanoAOD, but the methods can be applied to newer NanoAOD files.

## <a name="extend">"How can I add quantities to NanoAOD?"</a>

CMS expects that approximately 50% of physics analyses would be able to use only the physics and conditions information stored within NanoAOD files. Other analyses may prefer to analyze the MiniAOD format, which contains more information per event, albeit in the complex EDM class format. See the [Getting Started with CMS MiniAOD Data](/docs/cms-getting-started-miniaod) page for more details on analyzing MiniAOD.

One specific collection of information that users may wish to add to NanoAOD is the collection of "Particle Flow Candidates". Some collision data is available in this enriched format, called ["NanoAOD-PF"](https://opendata.cern.ch/search?q=CMS&f=file_type%3Ananoaod-pf). A [PFNano producer tool](/record/12504) is also available with instructions showing how a MiniAOD file can be processed to produce a NanoAOD-PF ROOT file.

That's it! Hope you enjoyed this introduction. Feel free to play around with the rest of the data and write your own analysis code. Learn more in [the CMS Open data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/).
