      "content": "DELPHI was a Particle Physics experiment at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. It studied the products of electron-positron collisions at the LEP circular accelerator, working at the then highest energies in the world. The main parts are still kept in the original state in the cavern where it was operating and can be visited."
