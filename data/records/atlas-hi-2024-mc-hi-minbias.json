All data were reprocessed using Athena Release 21, and new corresponding MC simulation samples were produced. These data and MC simulation datasets were processed into DAOD_HION14 format files; this is a light-weight data format intended for analysis of heavy ion minimum bias data, sufficient to support a wide variety of ATLAS analyses."

Designing and implementing a research-quality data analysis is a complex process that requires an understanding of particle physics; for those new to the subject, the open data designed for education (also linked below) might be a good starting point. Please be sure to cite the Open Data that you use, in line with the policy below.",
