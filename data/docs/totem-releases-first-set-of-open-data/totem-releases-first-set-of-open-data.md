Today, the TOTEM Collaboration published the first data set on the CERN Open
Data Portal. Data recorded by TOTEM is used to measure the total cross section
and to study elastic scattering in proton-proton collisions at the LHC for
different centre-of-mass energies. The data set contains only the information
from the Roman-Pot detectors. This data can be used to study elastic scattering
at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The open data release is accompanied by an
example analysis showing how to measure the elastic scattering cross section as
a function of the momentum transfer between the incoming protons and the total
cross section.

This release notably contains:

- [2011 Proton scattering data from Roman Pots at energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV](/record/84000)
- [Measurement of proton-proton elastic scattering and total cross-section at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV](/record/84001)
